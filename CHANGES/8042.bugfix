When upgrading from distro packages (`pulp_install_source==packages` & `pulp_pkg_upgrade_all==true`), pulp_installer will now configure dnf (CentOS/RHEL 8) to permit upgrading them to newer versions that are not necessarily the latest (dnf option `best=false`). This addresses the issue of python3-rq from EPEL8 being too new for Pulp, and thus upgrades failing with a depsolve error on the task "pulp_common : Upgrade all existing installed Pulp packages".
